## 1. Foundation: Understanding Databases

### What are Relational Databases?

Relational databases organize data into **tables** (relations) with rows and columns. Each table represents an entity (like customers, products, or orders), and relationships between tables are established through keys.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Tables**: Store data in structured format
- **Rows**: Individual records
- **Columns**: Attributes or fields
- **Relationships**: Connections between tables using keys

**Where You Need It:** Understanding relational databases is fundamental to working with any RDBMS like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server. This forms the conceptual foundation for all database work.

### RDBMS Benefits and Limitations

**Benefits:**
- **Data Integrity**: Enforces rules to maintain accuracy
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures reliable transactions
- **Structured Query Language**: Standardized way to interact with data
- **Scalability**: Can handle large amounts of data
- **Security**: Robust access control mechanisms

**Limitations:**
- **Rigid Schema**: Structure must be defined upfront
- **Vertical Scaling**: Can be expensive to scale
- **Complex Relationships**: May require multiple joins affecting performance
- **Not Ideal for Unstructured Data**: Works best with structured data

**Where You Need It:** This knowledge helps you choose the right database for your project and understand when to use SQL vs NoSQL solutions.

### SQL vs NoSQL Databases

**SQL Databases:**
- Structured data with fixed schema
- ACID transactions
- Vertical scaling
- Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle

**NoSQL Databases:**
- Flexible schema
- Horizontal scaling
- Eventual consistency
- Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis

**Where You Need It:** Making architectural decisions for applications, choosing between relational and document-based storage, or designing hybrid systems.

## 2. Getting Started with SQL

### Basic SQL Syntax

SQL (Structured Query Language) uses English-like commands to interact with databases.

**General Structure:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Where You Need It:** Every single database interaction requires understanding SQL syntax. This is your primary tool for working with data.

### SQL Keywords

**Common Keywords:**
- `SELECT`: Retrieve data
- `FROM`: Specify table
- `WHERE`: Filter results
- `INSERT`: Add new data
- `UPDATE`: Modify existing data
- `DELETE`: Remove data
- `JOIN`: Combine tables
- `GROUP BY`: Group rows
- `ORDER BY`: Sort results

**Where You Need It:** These keywords form the building blocks of all SQL queries. You'll use them daily in development, data analysis, and database administration.

### Data Types

**Numeric Types:**
- `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`: Whole numbers
- `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`: Precise decimal numbers
- `FLOAT`, `REAL`: Approximate decimal numbers

**String Types:**
- `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length strings
- `CHAR(n)`: Fixed-length strings
- `TEXT`: Long text data

**Date/Time Types:**
- `DATE`: Date only
- `TIME`: Time only
- `TIMESTAMP`: Date and time
- `INTERVAL`: Time span

**Boolean:**
- `BOOLEAN`: True/False values

**Where You Need It:** Creating tables, designing schemas, and ensuring data is stored efficiently and correctly. Choosing the wrong data type can lead to storage inefficiencies or data integrity issues.

### Operators

**Comparison Operators:**
- `=`, `!=`, `<>`: Equal, Not equal
- `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`: Less than, Greater than
- `BETWEEN`: Range check
- `IN`: Match any in list
- `LIKE`: Pattern matching

**Logical Operators:**
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`: Combine conditions

**Arithmetic Operators:**
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`: Mathematical operations

**Where You Need It:** Building complex queries with multiple conditions, filtering data precisely, and performing calculations.

## 3. Core SQL Statements

### SELECT Statement

The most fundamental SQL operation for retrieving data.

**Basic Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table_name;
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Select all columns
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customers;

-- Select with alias
SELECT first_name AS "First Name", last_name AS "Last Name" FROM customers;
```

**Where You Need It:** Every data retrieval operation, reporting, analytics, and application queries.

### INSERT Statement

Adds new records to a table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Insert single row
INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Insert multiple rows
INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES 
    ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane@example.com'),
    ('Bob', 'Johnson', 'bob@example.com');
```

**Where You Need It:** User registration, data migration, seeding databases, API endpoints that create resources.

### UPDATE Statement

Modifies existing records in a table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Update single record
UPDATE customers
SET email = 'newemail@example.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- Update multiple records
UPDATE products
SET price = price * 1.1
WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```

**Where You Need It:** Profile updates, inventory management, price changes, status updates in applications.

### DELETE Statement

Removes records from a table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Delete specific record
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- Delete with condition
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_date < '2020-01-01';
```

**Where You Need It:** Account deletion, data cleanup, archiving old records, removing invalid data.

## 4. Database Schemas

### What is a Schema?

A **schema** is a logical container or namespace that groups related database objects (tables, views, functions, etc.). Think of it as a folder that organizes your database objects.

**Key Concepts:**
- Provides organization and separation of concerns
- Enables multiple users to work without conflicts
- Allows same table names in different schemas
- Provides security boundaries
- Default schema in PostgreSQL is `public`

### Creating Schemas

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA schema_name;
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Create a schema for sales department
CREATE SCHEMA sales;

-- Create schema with authorization
CREATE SCHEMA hr AUTHORIZATION hr_manager;

-- Create schema with objects
CREATE SCHEMA inventory
    CREATE TABLE products (
        product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100)
    )
    CREATE TABLE categories (
        category_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(50)
    );
```

### Using Schemas

**Accessing Schema Objects:**
```sql
-- Fully qualified table name
SELECT * FROM sales.customers;
SELECT * FROM inventory.products;

-- Set search path (default schema)
SET search_path TO sales, public;

-- Now you can omit schema name
SELECT * FROM customers; -- Looks in sales.customers first
```

**Show Current Schema:**
```sql
SELECT current_schema();
```

**List All Schemas:**
```sql
SELECT schema_name 
FROM information_schema.schemata;

-- or in PostgreSQL
SELECT nspname FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace;
```

### Schema Organization Strategies

**1. By Department/Business Unit:**
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA sales;
CREATE SCHEMA marketing;
CREATE SCHEMA hr;
CREATE SCHEMA finance;

-- Each department has isolated tables
CREATE TABLE sales.orders (...);
CREATE TABLE sales.customers (...);
CREATE TABLE hr.employees (...);
CREATE TABLE finance.invoices (...);
```

**2. By Application/Module:**
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA auth;        -- Authentication & authorization
CREATE SCHEMA billing;     -- Billing and payments
CREATE SCHEMA analytics;   -- Reporting and analytics
CREATE SCHEMA audit;       -- Audit logs

CREATE TABLE auth.users (...);
CREATE TABLE auth.roles (...);
CREATE TABLE billing.subscriptions (...);
CREATE TABLE analytics.daily_stats (...);
```

**3. By Environment:**
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA dev;
CREATE SCHEMA staging;
CREATE SCHEMA prod;

-- Test in dev without affecting production
CREATE TABLE dev.test_customers (...);
CREATE TABLE prod.customers (...);
```

**4. By Data Lifecycle:**
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA current_data;
CREATE SCHEMA archived_data;
CREATE SCHEMA staging_data;

-- Move old data to archive
INSERT INTO archived_data.orders 
SELECT * FROM current_data.orders 
WHERE order_date < '2020-01-01';
```

### Schema Permissions

**Grant Access:**
```sql
-- Grant usage on schema
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA sales TO sales_team;

-- Grant create privilege
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA sales TO sales_admin;

-- Grant all privileges
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA sales TO sales_manager;

-- Grant access to all tables in schema
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA sales TO sales_team;

-- Grant access to future tables
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA sales
GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO sales_team;
```

**Revoke Access:**
```sql
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA sales FROM sales_team;
```

### Managing Schemas

**Alter Schema:**
```sql
-- Rename schema
ALTER SCHEMA old_name RENAME TO new_name;

-- Change owner
ALTER SCHEMA sales OWNER TO new_owner;
```

**Drop Schema:**
```sql
-- Drop empty schema
DROP SCHEMA schema_name;

-- Drop schema with all objects (dangerous!)
DROP SCHEMA schema_name CASCADE;

-- Safe drop
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS schema_name RESTRICT; -- Fails if not empty
```

### Schema Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Use schemas to organize large databases logically
- Separate production and development data
- Use schemas for multi-tenant applications (one schema per tenant)
- Document your schema organization strategy
- Use meaningful schema names
- Set appropriate permissions per schema

**❌ DON'T:**
- Mix unrelated data in the same schema
- Over-complicate with too many schemas
- Forget to set search_path in application connections
- Hard-code schema names in application code
- Use schemas as the only security layer

### Real-World Schema Examples

**E-commerce Application:**
```sql
-- Core business schemas
CREATE SCHEMA catalog;     -- Products, categories, inventory
CREATE SCHEMA orders;      -- Orders, order_items, shipping
CREATE SCHEMA customers;   -- Customer data, addresses, profiles
CREATE SCHEMA payments;    -- Transactions, payment methods

-- Supporting schemas
CREATE SCHEMA auth;        -- User authentication
CREATE SCHEMA marketing;   -- Campaigns, promotions
CREATE SCHEMA analytics;   -- Reporting tables, aggregates
CREATE SCHEMA audit;       -- Audit trails, logs

-- Create tables in appropriate schemas
CREATE TABLE catalog.products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(200),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE orders.orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Cross-schema foreign key
CREATE TABLE orders.order_items (
    order_item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders.orders(order_id),
    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES catalog.products(product_id),
    quantity INTEGER
);
```

**Multi-Tenant SaaS Application:**
```sql
-- Shared schema for common data
CREATE SCHEMA shared;

CREATE TABLE shared.tenants (
    tenant_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Individual schema per tenant
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_1;
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_2;
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_3;

-- Each tenant has isolated data
CREATE TABLE tenant_1.users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE tenant_2.users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Or use a function to dynamically create tenant schemas
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_tenant_schema(tenant_name TEXT)
RETURNS VOID AS $
BEGIN
    EXECUTE format('CREATE SCHEMA %I', tenant_name);
    EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE %I.users (
        user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(50),
        email VARCHAR(100)
    )', tenant_name);
    EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE %I.documents (
        document_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        title VARCHAR(200),
        content TEXT
    )', tenant_name);
END;
$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create new tenant
SELECT create_tenant_schema('tenant_acme_corp');
```

**Data Warehouse with Star Schema:**
```sql
-- Dimensional modeling schemas
CREATE SCHEMA dim;   -- Dimension tables
CREATE SCHEMA fact;  -- Fact tables
CREATE SCHEMA staging;  -- ETL staging area

-- Dimension tables
CREATE TABLE dim.customers (
    customer_key SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(50),
    -- Slowly changing dimension columns
    effective_date DATE,
    expiry_date DATE,
    is_current BOOLEAN
);

CREATE TABLE dim.products (
    product_key SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INTEGER,
    product_name VARCHAR(200),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    brand VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE dim.dates (
    date_key INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    full_date DATE,
    year INTEGER,
    quarter INTEGER,
    month INTEGER,
    day_of_week VARCHAR(10)
);

-- Fact table
CREATE TABLE fact.sales (
    sales_key SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    date_key INTEGER REFERENCES dim.dates(date_key),
    customer_key INTEGER REFERENCES dim.customers(customer_key),
    product_key INTEGER REFERENCES dim.products(product_key),
    quantity INTEGER,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    discount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Staging area for ETL
CREATE TABLE staging.raw_sales (
    transaction_id VARCHAR(50),
    transaction_date DATE,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    product_id INTEGER,
    quantity INTEGER,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

### Schema Migration Strategies

**Version Control:**
```sql
-- Track schema versions
CREATE SCHEMA metadata;

CREATE TABLE metadata.schema_versions (
    version_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    schema_name VARCHAR(50),
    version_number VARCHAR(20),
    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    description TEXT
);

-- Record migration
INSERT INTO metadata.schema_versions (schema_name, version_number, description)
VALUES ('sales', '1.0.0', 'Initial schema creation');
```

**Zero-Downtime Schema Changes:**
```sql
-- Step 1: Create new schema version
CREATE SCHEMA sales_v2;

-- Step 2: Copy and modify structure
-- (Your new table definitions here)

-- Step 3: Migrate data
INSERT INTO sales_v2.customers 
SELECT * FROM sales.customers;

-- Step 4: Switch application to new schema
-- Update application search_path

-- Step 5: Verify and cleanup
DROP SCHEMA sales CASCADE;
ALTER SCHEMA sales_v2 RENAME TO sales;
```

### Schema Information Queries

**List All Tables in Schema:**
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'sales';
```

**Get Schema Size:**
```sql
SELECT 
    schema_name,
    pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_total_relation_size(quote_ident(schemaname) || '.' || quote_ident(tablename)))::bigint) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'sales'
GROUP BY schema_name;
```

**List All Objects in Schema:**
```sql
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'sales'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

**Find Cross-Schema Dependencies:**
```sql
SELECT 
    dependent_ns.nspname AS dependent_schema,
    dependent_view.relname AS dependent_view,
    source_ns.nspname AS source_schema,
    source_table.relname AS source_table
FROM pg_depend 
JOIN pg_rewrite ON pg_depend.objid = pg_rewrite.oid 
JOIN pg_class AS dependent_view ON pg_rewrite.ev_class = dependent_view.oid 
JOIN pg_class AS source_table ON pg_depend.refobjid = source_table.oid 
JOIN pg_namespace dependent_ns ON dependent_view.relnamespace = dependent_ns.oid
JOIN pg_namespace source_ns ON source_table.relnamespace = source_ns.oid
WHERE dependent_ns.nspname != source_ns.nspname;
```

**Where You Need It:** 
- Large applications requiring logical separation of concerns
- Multi-tenant SaaS applications (schema per tenant)
- Data warehousing (separate schemas for dimensions, facts, staging)
- Team collaboration (different teams work in different schemas)
- Development vs Production separation
- Microservices architecture (each service gets its own schema)
- Complex applications with multiple modules
- Organizations with compliance requirements needing data segregation

## 5. Data Definition Language (DDL)

### CREATE TABLE

Defines a new table structure.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraints,
    column2 datatype constraints,
    ...
);
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    hire_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary > 0)
);
```

**Where You Need It:** Initial database setup, creating new features, database migrations, schema design.

### ALTER TABLE

Modifies existing table structure.

**Operations:**
```sql
-- Add column
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);

-- Drop column
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP COLUMN department;

-- Modify column
ALTER TABLE employees
ALTER COLUMN salary TYPE DECIMAL(12, 2);

-- Add constraint
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (email);
```

**Where You Need It:** Schema evolution, adding new features to existing tables, fixing design issues.

### DROP TABLE

Removes a table and all its data.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name; -- Safer option
```

**Where You Need It:** Removing obsolete tables, cleaning up test databases, major refactoring.

### TRUNCATE TABLE

Removes all rows from a table quickly.

**Syntax:**
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

**Difference from DELETE:**
- `TRUNCATE` is faster and uses less system resources
- `TRUNCATE` cannot be rolled back in some databases
- `TRUNCATE` resets auto-increment counters
- `DELETE` can have a WHERE clause, `TRUNCATE` cannot

**Where You Need It:** Clearing test data, resetting tables during development, bulk data refreshes.

---

## 5. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### FROM Clause

Specifies the table(s) to query.

**Examples:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- With table alias
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customers AS c;

-- Multiple tables
SELECT *
FROM orders, customers;
```

**Where You Need It:** Every SELECT query requires a FROM clause to specify the data source.

### WHERE Clause

Filters rows based on conditions.

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Simple condition
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE age > 18;

-- Multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE total_amount > 100 AND status = 'pending';

-- Pattern matching
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';

-- Range
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 50;

-- List
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped');
```

**Where You Need It:** Filtering data, searching records, conditional updates/deletes, data validation.

### ORDER BY Clause

Sorts query results.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Ascending order (default)
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY last_name;

-- Descending order
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;

-- Multiple columns
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;
```

**Where You Need It:** Displaying sorted lists, finding top/bottom records, organizing reports.

### GROUP BY Clause

Groups rows that have the same values.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) as total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Where You Need It:** Aggregating data, generating summaries, creating reports, analytics dashboards.

### HAVING Clause

Filters groups (used with GROUP BY).

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

**Difference from WHERE:**
- `WHERE` filters rows before grouping
- `HAVING` filters groups after aggregation

**Where You Need It:** Filtering aggregated results, finding groups that meet certain criteria.

---

## 6. JOIN Queries

JOINs combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.

### INNER JOIN

Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.first_name, customers.last_name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

**Where You Need It:** Fetching related data (e.g., orders with customer information), most common JOIN type.

### LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT customers.first_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

**Where You Need It:** Finding all records from one table including those without matches (e.g., customers who haven't placed orders).

### RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.first_name
FROM orders
RIGHT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

**Where You Need It:** Less common than LEFT JOIN, but useful when focusing on the second table's perspective.

### FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows when there's a match in either table.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT customers.first_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
FULL OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

**Where You Need It:** Finding all records from both tables, including unmatched ones (rare in practice).

### CROSS JOIN

Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT products.name, colors.color
FROM products
CROSS JOIN colors;
```

**Where You Need It:** Generating combinations, creating test data, specific mathematical operations.

### Self Join

Joins a table to itself.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT e1.first_name AS employee, e2.first_name AS manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

**Where You Need It:** Hierarchical data (organizational charts), comparing rows within the same table.

---

## 7. Aggregate Queries

Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single value.

### COUNT

Counts the number of rows.

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Count all rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

-- Count non-null values
SELECT COUNT(email) FROM customers;

-- Count distinct values
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) FROM customers;
```

**Where You Need It:** Dashboards, statistics, pagination, data validation.

### SUM

Calculates the total of numeric values.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

**Where You Need It:** Financial reports, revenue calculations, inventory totals.

### AVG

Calculates the average of numeric values.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) as average_salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```

**Where You Need It:** Performance metrics, statistical analysis, benchmarking.

### MIN and MAX

Find minimum and maximum values.

**Examples:**
```sql
SELECT MIN(price) as cheapest, MAX(price) as most_expensive
FROM products;

SELECT MIN(hire_date) as first_hire, MAX(hire_date) as latest_hire
FROM employees;
```

**Where You Need It:** Price ranges, date ranges, identifying outliers.

---

## 8. Data Constraints

Constraints enforce rules on data in tables.

### PRIMARY KEY

Uniquely identifies each row in a table.

**Properties:**
- Must be unique
- Cannot be NULL
- Only one per table (can be composite)

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Where You Need It:** Every table needs a primary key for data integrity and relationships.

### FOREIGN KEY

Links two tables together, ensuring referential integrity.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    order_date DATE
);
```

**Where You Need It:** Establishing relationships, preventing orphaned records, maintaining data consistency.

### UNIQUE

Ensures all values in a column are different.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

**Where You Need It:** Email addresses, usernames, SKU codes, any field requiring uniqueness.

### NOT NULL

Prevents null values in a column.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```

**Where You Need It:** Required fields, ensuring data completeness.

### CHECK

Validates that values meet a specific condition.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    age INTEGER CHECK (age >= 18),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary > 0),
    email VARCHAR(100) CHECK (email LIKE '%@%')
);
```

**Where You Need It:** Business rules enforcement, data validation, preventing invalid data entry.

---

## 9. Subqueries

A query nested inside another query.

### Types of Subqueries

**Scalar Subquery** (returns single value):
```sql
SELECT first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

**Column Subquery** (returns single column):
```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');
```

**Row Subquery** (returns single row):
```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE (category_id, price) = (SELECT category_id, MAX(price) FROM products GROUP BY category_id LIMIT 1);
```

**Table Subquery** (returns multiple rows and columns):
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
) AS dept_salaries
WHERE avg_salary > 50000;
```

### Nested Subqueries

Subqueries within subqueries.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT product_name
FROM products
WHERE category_id IN (
    SELECT category_id
    FROM categories
    WHERE category_name IN (
        SELECT category_name
        FROM popular_categories
        WHERE year = 2024
    )
);
```

### Correlated Subqueries

Subquery that references columns from the outer query.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT e1.first_name, e1.salary
FROM employees e1

FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email
FROM customers
WHERE status = 'active';

---

## 12. Indexes

Speed up data retrieval operations.

### Creating Indexes

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Single column index
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON customers (email);

-- Composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON customers (last_name, first_name);

-- Unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_username ON users (username);
```

### Managing Indexes

- Columns with frequent INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- Columns with low cardinality (few distinct values)

**Where You Need It:** Performance optimization, speeding up queries, improving application responsiveness.

---

## 13. Transactions

A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.

### Transaction Commands

**BEGIN**: Start transaction
```sql
BEGIN;
```

**COMMIT**: Save changes
```sql
COMMIT;
```

**ROLLBACK**: Undo changes
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

**SAVEPOINT**: Create checkpoint
```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- If everything is okay
COMMIT;

-- If there's an error
-- ROLLBACK;
```

### ACID Properties

**Atomicity**: All or nothing - transaction completes fully or not at all
**Consistency**: Database moves from one valid state to another
**Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
**Durability**: Committed changes are permanent

### Transaction Isolation Levels

**READ UNCOMMITTED**: Can read uncommitted changes (dirty reads)
**READ COMMITTED**: Can only read committed changes (default in PostgreSQL)
**REPEATABLE READ**: Same data throughout transaction
**SERIALIZABLE**: Complete isolation, as if transactions ran sequentially

**Example:**
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
BEGIN;
-- Your queries
COMMIT;
```

**Where You Need It:** Financial transactions, ensuring data consistency, preventing race conditions, multi-step operations.

---

## 14. Data Integrity & Security

### Data Integrity Constraints

Beyond basic constraints, consider:

**Referential Integrity:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE
ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

**Domain Integrity:**
```sql
CREATE DOMAIN email_address AS VARCHAR(255)
CHECK (VALUE ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}$');
```

### GRANT and REVOKE

Control access to database objects.

**GRANT:**
```sql
-- Grant SELECT permission
GRANT SELECT ON customers TO user_name;

-- Grant multiple permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON products TO developer_role;

-- Grant all permissions
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name TO admin_user;
```

**REVOKE:**
```sql
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON customers FROM user_name;
```

### Database Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Use Roles**: Group permissions into roles
3. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for passwords, credit cards
4. **Regular Backups**: Maintain backup schedule
5. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries
6. **Audit Logging**: Track database access and changes
7. **Strong Authentication**: Enforce password policies
8. **Network Security**: Restrict database access by IP
9. **Regular Updates**: Keep database software updated
10. **Secure Connections**: Use SSL/TLS for connections

**Where You Need It:** Production databases, compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA), multi-user systems.

---

## 15. Stored Procedures & Functions

Reusable SQL code stored in the database.

### Functions

**Creating a Function:**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_discount(price DECIMAL, discount_rate DECIMAL)
RETURNS DECIMAL AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN price * (1 - discount_rate);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Using the function
SELECT product_name, calculate_discount(price, 0.15) as discounted_price
FROM products;
```

### Stored Procedures

**Creating a Procedure:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE update_customer_status()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE customers
    SET status = 'inactive'
    WHERE last_login < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year';
END;
$$;

-- Calling the procedure
CALL update_customer_status();
```

**Where You Need It:** Complex business logic, batch operations, reducing network traffic, code reuse, centralized data validation.

---

## 16. Performance Optimization

### Using Indexes Effectively

**Best Practices:**
- Index columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY
- Use composite indexes for multi-column queries
- Monitor index usage and remove unused indexes
- Consider index size vs performance benefit

### Optimizing Joins

**Tips:**
- Use INNER JOIN when possible (faster than OUTER)
- Ensure JOIN columns are indexed
- Filter early with WHERE before joining
- Join on indexed columns

**Example:**
```sql
-- Bad: Large cartesian product then filter
SELECT * FROM orders, customers
WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
AND customers.country = 'USA';

-- Good: Filter then join
SELECT * FROM orders
INNER JOIN (SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA') c
ON orders.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

### Reducing Subqueries

**Replace with JOINs when possible:**
```sql
-- Subquery (slower)
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category_id IN (SELECT category_id FROM categories WHERE active = true);

-- JOIN (faster)
SELECT p.* FROM products p
INNER JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE c.active = true;
```

### Selective Projection

**Only SELECT needed columns:**
```sql
-- Bad: Retrieves unnecessary data
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';

-- Good: Only get what you need
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';
```

### Query Optimization Techniques

1. **Use EXPLAIN**: Analyze query execution plans
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 100;
```

2. **Avoid SELECT ***: Specify columns
3. **Use LIMIT**: Restrict results when appropriate
4. **Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns**: Prevents index usage
```sql
-- Bad
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024

-- Good
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date < '2025-01-01'
```

5. **Use EXISTS instead of IN for large subqueries**
6. **Partition Large Tables**: Split into smaller tables
7. **Update Statistics**: Keep query planner informed
8. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections

**Where You Need It:** Slow queries, high-traffic applications, large datasets, performance bottlenecks.

---

## 17. Advanced SQL

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Temporary named result sets.

**Syntax:**
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
WITH high_value_customers AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) as total_spent
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 10000
)
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, hvc.total_spent
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN high_value_customers hvc ON c.customer_id = hvc.customer_id;
```

**Multiple CTEs:**
```sql
WITH 
    sales_2024 AS (
        SELECT * FROM orders WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2024
    ),
    top_customers AS (
        SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) as total
        FROM sales_2024
        GROUP BY customer_id
        ORDER BY total DESC
        LIMIT 10
    )
SELECT c.first_name, tc.total
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN top_customers tc ON c.customer_id = tc.customer_id;
```

**Where You Need It:** Simplifying complex queries, improving readability, recursive queries, breaking down logic.

### Recursive Queries

Queries that reference themselves.

**Example (Organizational Hierarchy):**
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Anchor member: top-level employees
    SELECT employee_id, first_name, manager_id, 1 as level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive member: employees reporting to previous level
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy ORDER BY level, employee_id;
```

**Where You Need It:** Hierarchical data (org charts, categories), graph traversal, bill of materials, path finding.

### Window Functions

Perform calculations across rows related to the current row.

**ROW_NUMBER**: Assigns unique sequential number
```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    category,
    price,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) as rank_in_category
FROM products;
```

**RANK**: Assigns rank with gaps for ties
```sql
SELECT 
    student_name,
    score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) as rank
FROM exam_results;
```

**DENSE_RANK**: Assigns rank without gaps
```sql
SELECT 
    student_name,
    score,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) as dense_rank
FROM exam_results;
```

**LEAD**: Access next row's value
```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    total_amount,
    LEAD(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as next_order_amount
FROM orders;
```

**LAG**: Access previous row's value
```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    total_amount,
    LAG(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as previous_order_amount
FROM orders;
```

**Aggregate Window Functions:**
```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    total_amount,
    SUM(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as running_total,
    AVG(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as moving_avg_7days
FROM orders;
```

**Where You Need It:** Running totals, moving averages, ranking within groups, comparing with previous/next records, analytics dashboards.

### Pivot / Unpivot Operations

Transform rows into columns (PIVOT) or columns into rows (UNPIVOT).

**PIVOT Example (using CASE):**
```sql
-- Convert quarterly sales from rows to columns
SELECT 
    product_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q1' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Q1_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q2' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Q2_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q3' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Q3_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q4' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Q4_sales
FROM quarterly_sales
GROUP BY product_name;
```

**UNPIVOT Example (using UNION):**
```sql
-- Convert columns to rows
SELECT product_name, 'Q1' as quarter, q1_sales as sales FROM sales_data
UNION ALL
SELECT product_name, 'Q2' as quarter, q2_sales as sales FROM sales_data
UNION ALL
SELECT product_name, 'Q3' as quarter, q3_sales as sales FROM sales_data
UNION ALL
SELECT product_name, 'Q4' as quarter, q4_sales as sales FROM sales_data;
```

**Where You Need It:** Reporting, data transformation, preparing data for visualization, reshaping datasets.

### Dynamic SQL

SQL queries constructed and executed at runtime.

**PostgreSQL Example (using EXECUTE):**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_table_data(table_name TEXT)
RETURNS TABLE(result JSON) AS $
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY EXECUTE format('SELECT row_to_json(t) FROM %I t', table_name);
END;
$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Use Cases:**
- Building queries based on user input
- Generic reporting functions
- Database administration tasks
- Multi-tenant applications

**Security Warning:** Always sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection!

**Where You Need It:** Report generators, admin panels, flexible query builders, applications with dynamic filtering requirements.

---

## 18. Query Analysis Techniques

### Using EXPLAIN

Understand how PostgreSQL executes queries.

**Basic EXPLAIN:**
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';
```

**EXPLAIN ANALYZE** (actually runs the query):
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';
```

**Reading EXPLAIN Output:**
- **Seq Scan**: Sequential scan (reading entire table) - slow for large tables
- **Index Scan**: Using an index - faster
- **Bitmap Index Scan**: Using multiple indexes
- **Nested Loop**: Join method
- **Hash Join**: Join method using hash table
- **Merge Join**: Join method on sorted data
- **Cost**: Estimated cost (not time)
- **Rows**: Estimated number of rows
- **Actual Time**: Real execution time (with ANALYZE)

**Example Analysis:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT c.first_name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.country = 'USA'
AND o.order_date > '2024-01-01';
```

**Where You Need It:** Performance tuning, identifying bottlenecks, deciding on indexes, understanding query execution.

## 19. PostgreSQL vs MongoDB: When to Use Each

### Use PostgreSQL (Relational) When:

1. **Data has clear relationships** - Orders, customers, products with defined connections
2. **ACID compliance is critical** - Financial transactions, booking systems
3. **Complex queries needed** - Joins, aggregations, analytical queries
4. **Data integrity is paramount** - Consistent, validated data
5. **Schema is stable** - Structure doesn't change frequently
6. **Reporting and analytics** - BI tools, complex reports

**Example Use Cases:**
- Banking and financial systems
- E-commerce platforms
- ERP systems
- Healthcare records
- Accounting software

### Use MongoDB (NoSQL) When:

1. **Schema is flexible** - Rapidly evolving data structures
2. **Document-based data** - JSON-like data, nested structures
3. **Horizontal scaling needed** - Massive datasets distributed across servers
4. **High write throughput** - Logging, real-time analytics
5. **Hierarchical data** - Product catalogs with varying attributes
6. **Rapid prototyping** - Quick iteration without schema migrations

**Example Use Cases:**
- Content management systems
- Real-time analytics
- IoT applications
- Gaming leaderboards
- Social media feeds
- Mobile app backends

### Hybrid Approaches

Many modern applications use both:
- **PostgreSQL**: For transactional data (orders, payments, users)
- **MongoDB**: For content (blog posts, product descriptions, user-generated content)

## 22. Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Problem 1: N+1 Query Problem

**Bad Practice:**
```sql
-- Application makes 1 query for orders
SELECT * FROM orders;

-- Then N queries for each customer (one per order)
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 2;
-- ... repeats for each order
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Single query with JOIN
SELECT o.*, c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

### Problem 2: Implicit Type Conversion

**Bad Practice:**
```sql
-- customer_id is INTEGER, but querying with string
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = '123';
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Use correct type
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 123;
```

### Problem 3: Missing Indexes on Foreign Keys

**Problem:** Joins are slow because foreign keys aren't indexed.

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Always index foreign key columns
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
```

### Problem 4: Not Using Transactions

**Bad Practice:**
```sql
-- No transaction - partial updates if error occurs
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Use transaction
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

### Problem 5: Storing JSON/Arrays When Relational Would Be Better

**Bad Practice:**
```sql
-- Storing tags as JSON array
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200),
    tags JSON  -- ['tech', 'programming', 'sql']
);
```

**Better Solution:**
```sql
-- Proper relational design
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200)
);

CREATE TABLE tags (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE article_tags (
    article_id INTEGER REFERENCES articles(id),
    tag_id INTEGER REFERENCES tags(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (article_id, tag_id)
);
```
